# Co-HELP

This app is build with the intention to help people get real statistics of Covid 19 and to help people in need. 

This would help reduce the death rate of critical patients and also promote well being 
of the society as people in need would get a platform to seek help from different individuals. 

We have 3 main facilities available in this app : 
1. Covid Cases Statistics (It gives the current stats of covid cases all over World,in india in different states ,districts and cities of India,built using Public API)

2. Vaccination Centers Availability (It tells about the vaccination centers near you and gives the timing for slots available,built using Rest API)

3. Blood Plasma Donation (The one who wants help can post their details in the app.A user who is willing to help by donating can simply click on the email icon in the seeker's post and his email address along with his blood group and age will be informed to the one seeking. If the seeker finds it suitable , he/she could contact with them using gmail.)
   
   Users need to provide their email which would be a safer way to communicate rather that having the treat of data stealing and hence this will enable effective use of the application. 


Frameworks/Technologies â€“ Kotlin , Sqlite/Firebase Kotlin enables users to write compact and effective code along with eliminating Null References.
